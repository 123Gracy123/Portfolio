                <p class="card-text"> During the Livermore Lawrence National Lab Job Shadow on zoom, I was able to learn
                  more about the lab itself and the types of jobs it offers. Livermore Lawrence National Lab was created
                  in 1952. It currently has 521 facilities with a sister lab in Berkeley. One person that we talked to
                  was Karly Knox. Karly Know started off as an intern with a degree in chemistry. Her current
                  achievements at the laboratory is creating a molecule that turns into safe plastic. We additionally
                  talked with Marc Stearman, who has a bachelors in Computer Science. His current job requires him to
                  work with a lot of chemists, UNIX servers, nuclear weapon stimulations, and the lab’s storage and
                  network evolution. One important advice he gave was how computer science could be applied into many
                  other fields. We also got to take a look at the National Ignition Facility Laser, where the largest
                  laser in the world resides. The light that comes out of this laser is 20 feet long and travels at a
                  100 trillion of a second. It uses a thermonuclear process, similar to a microwave, except with the use
                  of x-rays. The laser needs a lot of space to amplify the laser and protect the optic. I really
                  appreciated this field trip over zoom, because it opened my eyes to working at the lab as one of my
                  options after college. Previously, I was unaware that all different types of majors can work in the
                  laboratory.

                <p class="card-text"> In the biotechnology career presentation over zoom I was able to interact with
                  several individuals about this thriving industry. The presenter, Josie Sette is a director of
                  biotechnology and she talked about how a biotech certificate can get you into a variety of careers
                  such as biomedical technician, manufacturing technician, quality control technician, and animal
                  technician. The definition of biotechnology is “the use of biological knowledge and modern
                  technologies to make useful products from living organisms and biological processes”. Bioengineering,
                  biochemistry, and chemical engineering combine to become biotechnology. This applies to biologics that
                  fight cancer, drug and gene therapies(CRISPR), mRNA vaccines to combat COVID - 19, stem cell research,
                  creating sustainable clothing and leather made from plants and mushrooms and meat substitutes. This
                  presentation opened my eyes to pursuing biotechnology because it can be applied to any field. I additionally went to the computer science and digital media presentation on zoom. The presentor, Ray Kaupp is the regional director of ICT/DM. From this presentation, I learned that technology is required in any company, therefore, there will always be job openings. The bay area is the perfect place to have a job because there are an abundance of tech companies. As someone interested in the community college route, I appreciated learning more about getting an associates in computer science, and then transferring to a UC or CSU.

                <p class="card-text"> On the Entrepreneurship Summit over zoom, I was able to learn about young
                  individuals who were able to start their own companies. One entrepreneur I found inspiring was Amrit
                  Robins. Mr. Robins is the CEO and founder of Axiom Cloud. His journey as an entrepreneur started when
                  he went to Stanford for political science to solve climate change. The method he took was similar to
                  the scientific method. He started with testing assumptions by interviewing to get more data, created a
                  fundraising plan to create the company, received answers to the assumptions, built prototypes, and
                  lastly got the first employee. With this method, Mr. Robins was able to earn money which attracted
                  customers and more employees. One key point he emphasized was that it isn't hard to start your own
                  business because other companies have already done those things. He additionally said that the hard
                  part of starting your own business is finding a problem and solving it, as well as having dedicated
                  people on the team. Mr. Robins talked about how crucial it is to work hard, to find responsible
                  employees, and have a committed relationship with them so that they stay with the company.

                <p class="card-text"> This Autodesk University field trip spanned 3 days with several different
                  workshops and keynote speakers. I attended one keynote and two workshops. In the Architecture,
                  Engineering and Construction Design Keynote, a video was played. The ideas presented were based on
                  challenges engineers and architectures faced due to COVID-19. Nicholas Mangon talked about what
                  adjustments were made, such as moving projects to the cloud and using Forged. Forged is a platform
                  that provides a secure foundation for data sharing by connecting designers. Through this keynote, I
                  learned useful information on how people have to adapt and alter their jobs as different hurdles come
                  in the way. One of the two workshops I attended was Dynamo for Civil 3D: Automated Checks of
                  Openformat Road Design Made Easy. In this workshop, I learned more about Autodesk Civil 3D tools. One
                  of the many speakers, Ellisa Ambrassa, is a structural engineer and she discussed the typical process
                  of using Civil 3D. The steps are to first import landXML, prepare the imported surface in the Civil 3D
                  environment, set the design criteria, create horizontal alignments, create vertical profiles, check
                  any design violations, and lastly fix errors and modify according to the design requirements. The last
                  workshop I attended was the Crossroads of Civil 3D and Revit, where I learned more about how Civil 3D
                  and Revit can work together because they both specialize in different things. Civil 3D is mostly good
                  for all types of modeling, except Revit is better when it comes to corridors, walls, and wings on a
                  cross-section. Sometimes both are used to create better designs, like bridges. The abutments and roads
                  are made using Civil 3D and axis alignment parameters are made using Revit.

                <p class="card-text" style="color:black"> On this Splunk Field Trip over zoom, I learned a lot about Splunk from three
                  speakers. The first speaker, Eric Fusilero, is the VP of the global technical enablement and education
                  ecosystem. He talked about customers’ success and the steps they can take to make sure that they are
                  successful. The second speaker, Ashima Puri, is the chief of staff to the chief people officer. She
                  spoke about how it is necessary to get a job that you are passionate about. She additionally talked
                  about how a career isn't a straight line. The last speaker, Dane Dungca has been in the company for 4
                  months as an intern for corporate philanthropy from San Francisco State University. In the first year
                  of his college, he did a year up program where he got a chance to discover different professions as he
                  didn't know his interest going into college. It was really inspiring hearing from him because he
                  learned about his passions through his years in college. All three of these speakers helped me learn
                  more about Splunk and how they manage Data. Some Data they manage are Cloud, 5g, IoT, AI, platforms,
                  mobility, virtualization, and robotic process automation. This field trip was very useful because I
                  got to learn more about Splunk and it also influenced me to work for Splunk if I ever get the chance.

                <p class="card-text">Sravanthi Rajanala is a director of machine learning and artificial intelligence at
                  Walmart Global Tech. She did all of her education in India and first started off as a software
                  engineer before she gained interest in deep learning. As someone who plans on pursuing machine
                  learning in the future, I was glad to learn more about the process through Mrs. Rajanala. One of the
                  main things that I took away from her is that for any machine learning model to be accurate, it is
                  important that the data doesn’t have any biases. The more variability it has, the better it is for the
                  computer to apply the data in a real world situation. Once the data is gathered, the model has to be
                  trained multiple times with different samples. Then it is ready to get exported. I additionally
                  learned more about the algorithms themselves, which are just mathematical techniques that solve
                  multiple variables in a problem. Ms. Rajanala inspired me to continue pursuing artificial intelligence
                  in the future. AI is used in almost everything and creating a model that learns from itself is very
                  intriguing.

                <p class="card-text"> Donald James is a retired worker for the National Aeronautics Space
                  Administration, better known as NASA. His original plan was to only work for NASA in order to gain
                  some experience. However, working for NASA was a big deal and once people started asking him for
                  autographs, he decided to stick with NASA permanently. One thing that helped him reach recognition by
                  many people, including former president Obama, was his manners. He witnessed how being smart wasn’t
                  enough because even smart people could get fired due to their poor manners. These manners should be
                  expressed through empathy, behavior, and verbally. Mr. James helped me realize that a successful
                  person is not someone who may appear knowledgable, it is someone who is well rounded. Being as equally
                  mannered and respectful can take you further in life or as the title of his book says, “Manners Will
                  Take You Where Brains and Money Won't”. I was greatly inspired by Mr. James presentation and words. I
                  was lucky enough to get my copy of his book signed by him.

                <h6>April 2021</h6>
                <p class="card-text"> Gracie Ermi is a research software engineer at Vulcan inc in Seattle. Her job
                  requires her to build artificial intelligence to support wildlife research. One of the things she has
                  worked on is automating the process of looking at multiple images and videos for wildlife surveys.
                  These wildlife surveys take an extremely long time as an individual has to look through each media and
                  count the population. So her team worked on elephants specifically and trained a machine learning
                  module to identify the elephants in the picture, which made the lives of scientists easier. She also
                  went into what exactly machine learning is. Machine learning is a technique in artificial intelligence
                  and the goal is to get a computer to do a task by itself without a human. In order to do this,
                  multiple pictures are labeled and a machine learning robot uses those images to identify the
                  difference using all the angles. After looking at the images and their pixels, it could accurately
                  identify in the future what that image is. Ms. Ermi did this specifically with elephants which counted
                  all the elephants in the media by recognizing similarities that it has learned by itself. After doing
                  this, she and her team started doing the same with whales. They were able to track the health of each
                  whale by looking at the pattern on their back which makes them unique.

                <p class="card-text"> Andrea Madotto is a Ph.D. student in Electronic & Computer Engineering at the Hong
                  Kong University of Science and Technology. During the zoom session, he spoke about conversational
                  modeling and language generation. He discussed several natural language generation machines in a
                  timeline starting from GPT-2 or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, all the way to GPT-3. He went into
                  more extensive details about how the GPT-3 works and how it takes in information using a statistical
                  code and gives a certain output depending on what was entered. He additionally addressed how the GPT-3
                  picks its certain output by going through its database and picking a word that is rated with the
                  highest numerical value. This I found quite fascinating. This talk was highly informational. I got a
                  chance to learn how chat boxes use artificial intelligence to give an output that sounds like a human,
                  rather than a machine. This talk was highly inspirational as well, partly because I too am interested
                  in artificial intelligence and the way a machine can learn from itself. This was definitely an
                  interesting and engaging guest speaker.

            <p>During my junior year, I was lucky enough to have 2 great mentors who were able to guide me for the future. My primary mentor was Jose Martinez, but I was able to gain some insights from my partner's mentor, Chris Hunt. Mr. Martinez is a retired civil engineer who went to UC Berkeley and worked for the City of Oakland. A few of the projects he have worked on are the Hover Dam, Golden Gate Bridge, and the Space Needle in Seattle. Similarily, Mr. Hunt is a civil and geotechnical engineer who went to UC Berkeley. He works as a senior principle for Geosyntec Consultants. Although I do not want to pursue civil engineering, both of my mentors helped me with perfecting my resume and responses for interview questions. One thing I learned from my mentors regarding my interest, programming, was that it wasn't always done on a computer. Previously, programming punch cards were used and inserted into the computer, which read the code off of the paper. Another thing I learned from my mentors and this experience was that during interviews, it is important to say that you have background in being both a leader and follower. Buisnesses want to see people who know how to lead projects, but also follow when needed. I additonally gained insight from my mentors on how community college can be benefitial and cheaper. Going to a comunity college and then transfering to a UC has always been my plan, so I am thankful that my mentors gave me reasuring advice.</p>

  <!--<h6>November 2019</h6>
              <p class="card-text"> Mr. Hightower was one of the guest speakers we had in CSP. He is the 2018 Java champion that was selected out of 7.1 million java developers. He is also the author of a bestselling agile development book. During his presentation he talked about how he didn't have good grades in high school. This was surprising to me. He also talked about how he worked on NFL servers.
              <br>
              <br>
              This guest speaker inspired me to achieve what seems impossible. Becoming a Java champion is a great accomplishment, especially when it is out 7.1 million other developers. I was also inspired to do better after high school just like Mr. Hightower. Even though he didn't have good grades, he still became a very good coder later on in his life.
