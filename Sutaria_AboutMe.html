                <p class="card-text">When I graduate from an university, I plan to work in a major company that needs machine learning engineers to create AI. I am interested in this field because someone who makes artificial intelligence can’t be taken over or automated like other jobs. I always loved creating codes, working with robots, and designing web pages. I would be able to code a webpage that is used world wide. Furthermore, I would be able to control robots movements and actions to test out the artificial intelligence. I plan to be on a team that makes a company look better than it is already by improving parts of their webpages. One example of a place I intend to be a machine learning engineer is at Amazon. On the Amazon page there is always someone that is updating the recommended feature that tells you what you are interested in. As a result, machine learning engineers will be highly needed because every company shows related or recommended items. <!--This is my first paragraph about my personal career goal -->  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                I am the best fit to a machine learning engineer because of my accuracy, open mindedness, and thoroughness. When I write a code I make sure that I don’t make any mistakes so that the code is accurate. I am also open minded to new ideas so that I can alter my code to make it short and easy to read. I am also thorough with my jobs. Once I start a task, I make sure that I get it all done on time and fast.

                <br>
                <br>
                One of my major accomplishments is taking AP computer science and excelling with an A. In many other classes like French and advanced English I have also maintained an A. From this I have learned that the effort you put in, is exactly what is reflected in your grade.</p>
