                <p class="card-text">When I graduate from a university, I plan to work in a major company that needs Machine Learning Engineers to create Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in this field because it is impossible for this job to be automated as someone who makes Artificial Intelligence can’t be taken over or automated like other jobs. I have always loved creating codes, working with robots, and designing web pages. By being a Machine Learning Engineer, I would be able to code a worldwide webpage and I would be able to code the movements and actions of a robot to test out the Artificial Intelligence. I plan to be on a team that makes a company look better than it is already by improving parts of its webpages. One example of a place I intend to be a Machine Learning Engineer is at Amazon. On the Amazon page, there is always someone that is updating the recommended feature that tells you what you are interested in. As a result, Machine Learning Engineers will be highly needed because every company shows related or recommended items. I plan to achieve this goal by broadening my coding skills and learning more about Machine Learning even after graduating from a university. <!--This is my first paragraph about my personal career goal -->  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                I am the best fit to a Machine Learning Engineer because of my motivation, open mindedness, and thoroughness. Often times when I am stuck on a code or an assignment in general, I don't give up. Although at times things seem impossible, I know that I should never give up and instead keep on persevering. I am also open minded to new ideas proposed by other people so that I can change my codes and make them better. Furthermore, I am thorough with my jobs. Once I start a task, I make sure that I get it done on time, fast, and better than what was asked.</p>

             One of my major accomplishments is taking AP computer science as well as Honors principles of engineering and excelling with an A. In many other classes like French 2 and advanced English, I have also maintained an A. From this, I have learned that the effort you put in, is exactly what is reflected in your grade. I have additionally learned from myself that you got to take risks in your life because without risk there is no reward. Before covid-19, I was part of the Dublin High School track team and it required me to practice for one and a half hours everyday. This was pretty hard for me because I got home at 6 o’clock, which left me with little time to do my homework. However, I took the risk and I am glad that I did because I learned from myself that I can multitask and manage my time wisely.
