                <p class="card-text">As a student interested in programming, I aspire to be a Machine Learning Engineer. After college, I hope to work for major companies that require artificial intelligece. I am interested in this field because someone who programms AI models, can never become automated itself. Through my experience of taking multiple engineering classes at Dublin High School, I have developed many skills that would help me succeed in the future. I am able to code in a variety of languages, such as html/css, java, and python, which all are languages that have use today. With these skills, I am able to code a range of things, from websites, to apps, to games. I would love to broaden my knowledge and learn more programming languages over the years.</p>

                I am the best fit for a Machine Learning Engineer because of my motivation, open-mindedness, and thoroughness. Often when I am stuck on a code or an assignment in general, I don't give up. Although at times things seem impossible, I know that I should keep on persevering. I am additionally open-minded to new ideas proposed by other people, so that I can change my codes and make them concise and effective. Furthermore, I am thorough with my jobs. Once I start a task, I make sure that I get it done on time, fast, and better than what was asked.

              One of my major accomplishments is taking AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science Applications and excelling with an A. Programming was initially hard for me at first. However, once I started coding a little bit, day by day, I slowly was able to get better. Eventually, I was able to get a Microsoft certification in HTML and CSS. From this, I have learned that the effort you put in, is exactly what is reflected in your grades.</p>
