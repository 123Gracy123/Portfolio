                <p class="card-text">When I graduate from a university, I plan to work in a company that requires Machine Learning Engineers to create artificial intelligence. I am interested in this field because someone who makes artificial intelligence can not be taken over or automated like other jobs. I have always loved creating codes, working with robots, and designing web pages. By becoming a Machine Learning Engineer, I would be able to code webpages, used worldwide and the movements and actions of a robot. I plan to be on a team that makes a company look more promising by improving parts of its web pages. One example of a place I intend to be a Machine Learning Engineer is at Amazon. The Amazon website, similar to many shopping websites, uses artificial intelligence to recommend what other items the user might be interested in. As a result, Machine Learning Engineers will be highly needed because every company shows related or recommended items. I plan to achieve this goal by broadening my coding skills and learning more about Machine Learning even after graduating from a university.</p>

                I am the best fit for a Machine Learning Engineer because of my motivation, open-mindedness, and thoroughness. Often when I am stuck on a code or an assignment in general, I don't give up. Although at times things seem impossible, I know that I should keep on persevering. I am additionally open-minded to new ideas proposed by other people, so that I can change my codes and make them concise and effective. Furthermore, I am thorough with my jobs. Once I start a task, I make sure that I get it done on time, fast, and better than what was asked.</p>

             One of my major accomplishments is taking AP Computer Science as well as Honors Principles of Engineering and excelling with an A. In many other classes like French 2 and Advanced English, I have also received an A. From this, I have learned that the effort you put in, is exactly what is reflected in your grades. I have also learned that it is necessary to take risks in your life because without taking risks, there is no reward. Before covid-19, I was part of the Dublin High School track team and it required me to practice for one and a half hours every day. This was hard for me because I got home at 6 oâ€™clock, which left me with little time to do my homework. However, I took the risk and I am glad that I did because I learned from myself that I can multitask and manage my time wisely.
