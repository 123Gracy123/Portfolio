              <p class="card-text">The objective of this project was to create a game or a story using Scratch. My partner and I decided to make a hide and seek game. The main goal of the game was to find all the characters in each of the levels with the time given. Some features of the game are moving up, down, left, or right to go to different backdrops. Another feature was adding a point to your score everytime you find a character that is hiding.This game has 3 different levels. The first level is castle themed with 30 seconds to find the first character. The second level is beach themed which adds another character and the time is reduced to 20 seconds. The last level has three different characters with a playground theme with only 10 seconds to find all of the characters. My role is this project was to create levels 1 and 3. I was also responsible for making the base of the game and sharing it with my partner.  </p>

              <p class="card-text"> The objective of this project was to make one of the tutorial apps in MIT app inventor better than it already was. My partner and I made a better version of Colored Dots. Some of the features that were already in the app were creating your own colors, testing these colors, reseting the brush selector, changing the size of the dot, a canvas, and saving the colors. The features that my partner and I added were an eraser button, scribbling on the canvas instead of just drawing dots, and a button for every color such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. My role in this project was to come up with 2 of the new features and figure out how to incorporate them into the code. In addition, I was responsible for making sure that the daily log was updated frequently. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> The objective of this project was to brainstorm, design, test, and develop a humane way to catch Santa Claus using a Rube Golderberg machine. This machine would have to consist of levers, pulleys, and other mechanisms made out of common materials. For this project I worked with Kiki Feng, Anish Patil, and Khushi Kannawadi. My role in this project was to design as well as build the trigger of the machine. In my specific portion of this project I made a pulley, lever, and inclined plane. My group did face some challenges as one of the team members didn't design, build, or test the part 2 of the trigger. However, my group informed the teacher and worked together to finish the project without the part 2. So instead, our video showed only part 1 of the trigger that transitions to the capture part 1 and part 2. From this project, I learned a lot about simple machines and how they function. Overall, this project was very fun to design, build, and put together. </p>
