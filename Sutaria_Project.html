                    <p class="card-text"> The purpose of this project was to utilise any programming language to obtain
                      some sort of data. Although this class is mainly for java, my group used python to scrape data off
                      of soundcloud. From the data we revieved, we were able to see the correlation between the song's
                      genre and amount of likes, as well as what pattern songs have that keep them on the top charts. I
                      worked with Kaitlyn Kwan, Zoe Homan, and Andrew Zou to complete this project. My role specifically
                      was to do all parts of the coding that required beautifulSoup to scrape the integral parts of the
                      website. The main takeaway from this project was that data is integral to finding patterns that
                      could be helpful to scientists. Some challenges that I faced, were finding the containers that we
                      could scrape to recieve the data. This took a long time since the code would produce no outputs.

                    <h6>June 2021</h6>
                    <p class="card-text"> The purpose of this project was to apply knowledge from Runestone's APCSA
                      review units 10, 11, and 12 which we learned over the summer, to create a board game using
                      Greenfoot. The requirements of this board game were to create a game with 40 tiles, 10 questions
                      associated with the tiles, a 2 player game, and an automated dice which moves the player. For this
                      summer project I worked with 2 other classmates and my role specifically was to create a title
                      page, an instruction page, a dice that rolls when the user clicks on it, and questions which ask
                      for the userâ€™s input. Some challenges my group had were making sure the player only moved on the
                      tiles. However we were able to overcome this by checking if the player was standing on a certain
                      color of the game and rotating the player's direction until it was on the tile. This project was
                      one of the first times I coded in Java and I was able to learn a lot of essential algorithms that
                      would help me with coding in the future. </p>

                    <p class="card-text"> The objective of this project was to create the cheapest bridge using a bridge
                      design software. In this project, I worked with Kiki Feng, Sruti Mani, and Anish Patil. My
                      specific contribution to this project was individually designing 2 bridges, working on the
                      documentation and the slides, as well as modifying Kiki's design to produce the final design. Our
                      bridge came to a final cost of $182,970.52. The challenge that I personally faced was not being
                      able to download the bridge design software because I had a Chromebook. However, I quickly
                      overcame this hurdle by using my mom's computer which could download the software. Additionally in
                      this project, one team member didn't complete their parts on time, which delayed the remainder of
                      the project because without all the designs we couldn't select a final design. Yet, we eventually
                      finished the project on time. From this project, I learned that teamwork is everything because,
                      without the contribution from one member, it is nearly impossible to complete and finish
                      everything. I additionally learned a lot about compression and tension forces that influence the
                      sturdiness of truss bridges. </p>

                  <p class="card-text"> The objective of this project was to brainstorm, design, test, and develop a
                    humane way to catch Santa Claus using a Rube Golderberg machine. This machine would have to consist
                    of levers, pulleys, and other mechanisms made out of common materials. For this project I worked
                    with Kiki Feng, Anish Patil, and Khushi Kannawadi. My role in this project was to design as well as
                    build the trigger of the machine. In my specific portion of this project I made a pulley, lever, and
                    inclined plane. My group did face some challenges as one of the team members didn't design, build,
                    or test the part 2 of the trigger. However, my group informed the teacher and worked together to
                    finish the project without the part 2. So instead, our video showed only part 1 of the trigger that
                    transitions to the capture part 1 and part 2. From this project, I learned a lot about simple
                    machines and how they function. Overall, this project was very fun to design, build, and put
                    together. </p>

                  <p class="card-text" style="color:black"> The objective of this project was to make one of the tutorial apps in MIT app
                    inventor better than it already was. My partner and I made a better version of Colored Dots. Some of
                    the features that were already in the app were creating your own colors, testing these colors,
                    reseting the brush selector, changing the size of the dot, a canvas, and saving the colors. The
                    features that my partner and I added were an eraser button, scribbling on the canvas instead of just
                    drawing dots, and a button for every color such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. My
                    role in this project was to come up with 2 of the new features and figure out how to incorporate
                    them into the code. In addition, I was responsible for making sure that the daily log was updated
                    frequently. </p>

                  <p class="card-text" style="color:black">The objective of this project was to create a game or a story using Scratch. My
                    partner and I decided to make a hide and seek game. The main goal of the game was to find all the
                    characters in each of the levels with the time given. Some features of the game are moving up, down,
                    left, or right to go to different backdrops. Another feature was adding a point to your score
                    everytime you find a character that is hiding.This game has 3 different levels. The first level is
                    castle themed with 30 seconds to find the first character. The second level is beach themed which
                    adds another character and the time is reduced to 20 seconds. The last level has three different
                    characters with a playground theme with only 10 seconds to find all of the characters. My role is
                    this project was to create levels 1 and 3. I was also responsible for making the base of the game
                    and sharing it with my partner. </p>
