  <!--<h6>November 2019</h6>
              <p class="card-text"> Devon Martin is a software engineer that works at chevron. He was a guest speaker that came in my CSP class. He talked about his day to day life working for chevron. One of the many things he talked about was how his job requires good communication skills.He explained that this communication is very important because he spends 50% of his day in meetings. I was very intrigued when he said that his company provides time to do personal developments. Furthermore, I was fascinated when he said Chevron doesn't want their workers to bring work home.
              <br>
              <br>
              This guest speaker helped me learn more about what software engineers really do and how their day to day life is. From his presentation I was inspired to know more about Chevron and their 5 year rotation program. This program is where the software engineers can rotate their job and take up something new every 2 years. I believe that this is a great way for engineers to not be bored and work on the same thing.

              <!--The color of this text is in navy blue-->
  <!--<h6>November 2019</h6>
              <p class="card-text"> Mr. Hightower was one of the guest speakers we had in CSP. He is the 2018 Java champion that was selected out of 7.1 million java developers. He is also the author of a bestselling agile development book. During his presentation he talked about how he didn't have good grades in high school. This was surprising to me. He also talked about how he worked on NFL servers.
              <br>
              <br>
              This guest speaker inspired me to achieve what seems impossible. Becoming a Java champion is a great accomplishment, especially when it is out 7.1 million other developers. I was also inspired to do better after high school just like Mr. Hightower. Even though he didn't have good grades, he still became a very good coder later on in his life.
