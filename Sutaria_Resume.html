              <!--The color of this text is in navy blue--> 
              <h6>December 2020</h6>
              <p class="card-text"> On this Splunk Field Trip over zoom, I learned a lot about Splunk from three speakers. The first speaker, Eric Fusilero, is the VP of the global technical enablement and education ecosystem. He talked about customersâ€™ success and the steps they can take to make sure that they are successful. The second speaker, Ashima Puri, is the chief of staff to the chief people officer. She spoke about how it is necessary to get a job that you are passionate about. She additionally talked about how a career isn't a straight line. The last speaker, Dane Dungca has been in the company for 4 months as an intern for corporate philanthropy from San Francisco State University. In the first year of his college, he did a year up program where he got a chance to discover different professions as he didn't know his interest going into college. It was really inspiring hearing from him because he learned about his passions through his years in college. All three of these speakers helped me learn more about Splunk and how they manage Data. Some Data they manage are Cloud, 5g, IoT, AI, platforms, mobility, virtualization, and robotic process automation. This field trip was very useful because I got to learn more about Splunk and it also influenced me to work for Splunk if I ever get the chance.

              <h6>March 2021</h6>
              <p class="card-text"> Andrea Madotto is a Ph.D. student in Electronic & Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. During the zoom session, he spoke about conversational modeling and language generation. He discussed several natural language generation machines in a timeline starting from GPT-2 or Generative Pre-trained Transformer, all the way to GPT-3. He went into more extensive details about how the GPT-3 works and how it takes in information using a statistical code and gives a certain output depending on what was entered. He additionally addressed how the GPT-3 picks its certain output by going through its database and picking a word that is rated with the highest numerical value. This I found quite fascinating. This talk was highly informational. I got a chance to learn how chat boxes use artificial intelligence to give an output that sounds like a human, rather than a machine. This talk was highly inspirational as well, partly because I too am interested in artificial intelligence and the way a machine can learn from itself. This was definitely an interesting and engaging guest speaker.

              <!--<h6>November 2019</h6>
              <p class="card-text"> Devon Martin is a software engineer that works at chevron. He was a guest speaker that came in my CSP class. He talked about his day to day life working for chevron. One of the many things he talked about was how his job requires good communication skills.He explained that this communication is very important because he spends 50% of his day in meetings. I was very intrigued when he said that his company provides time to do personal developments. Furthermore, I was fascinated when he said Chevron doesn't want their workers to bring work home.
              <br>
              <br>
              This guest speaker helped me learn more about what software engineers really do and how their day to day life is. From his presentation I was inspired to know more about Chevron and their 5 year rotation program. This program is where the software engineers can rotate their job and take up something new every 2 years. I believe that this is a great way for engineers to not be bored and work on the same thing.

              <!--<h6>November 2019</h6>
              <p class="card-text"> Mr. Hightower was one of the guest speakers we had in CSP. He is the 2018 Java champion that was selected out of 7.1 million java developers. He is also the author of a bestselling agile development book. During his presentation he talked about how he didn't have good grades in high school. This was surprising to me. He also talked about how he worked on NFL servers.
              <br>
              <br>
              This guest speaker inspired me to achieve what seems impossible. Becoming a Java champion is a great accomplishment, especially when it is out 7.1 million other developers. I was also inspired to do better after high school just like Mr. Hightower. Even though he didn't have good grades, he still became a very good coder later on in his life.
